studied 2 effects on rho:
alpha1 and gamma1

In all cases, there are oscilations, eventually approching a limiting behavior in all x and t
alpha1 controls the rho value that the end behavior ends on
gamma1 controls how much oscillation or how quickly the rho values will reach that limiting behavior

effect of mu: mu also limits end-behavior of rho similar to alpha1

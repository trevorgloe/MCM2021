abstract = { A mathematical model that reproduces fungal proliferation and morphological colony formation was developed on the basis of a reaction diffusion modelling approach. In this modelling, fungal life stage was separated into two, active and inactive stage, and it was assumed that active fungus moves by diffusion and reaction while generating and producing inactive fungus. The effects of temperature and humidity on fungal growth were explicitly incorporated in the reaction term of nutrient consumption/production of active fungus in this governing equation. The damping function, which reproduces the effects of temperature and humidity on fungal growth, was developed and explicitly based on the fungal index proposed by K. Abe. In order to estimate the sensitivity of the proposed numerical fungal growth model, fungal growth on the surface of building materials was analysed for four types of building materials, and the prediction results were compared with the results of WUFI-Bio and the fungal index. }

	abstract = {In this work, we present a new PDE model of the growth of Postia placenta, a species of brown rot fungus. The formulation was derived mainly from the biological mechanisms embedded in our discrete model, validated against experimental data. In order to mimic the growth mechanisms, we propose a new reaction-diffusion formulation, based on three variables: the concentration of tips, the branch density and the total hyphal density. The evolution of tips obeys a reaction-diffusion model, with constant diffusivity, while the evolution of the two other variables results from time integrals. The numerical solution is in excellent agreement with the averaged radial tip/hyphal densities of the mycelial network obtained by the discrete model. Thanks to the efficient exponential Euler method with Krylov subspace approximation, the solution needs only 3.5 s of CPU time to simulate 104-day of mycelium growth, in comparison with 8 hours for the discrete model. The great reduction of the RAM memory and computing time gives the possibility to upscale the simulation. The novelty of the PDE system is that the spatial colonization is formulated as a diffusion mechanism, which is self-standing, contrary to models based on an advection term. The continuous model can also reproduce the radial densities when the growth parameters in the discrete model are varied to adapt to different growth conditions. The correlation constructed between the two models provides us a tool for mutual insights between local biological mechanisms to the global biomass distribution, especially when analyzing experimental data.}

	Abstract = {Fungi are the primary agents of terrestrial decomposition, yet our understanding of fungal biogeography lags far behind that of plants, animals and bacteria. Here, we use a trait-based approach to quantify the niches of 23 species of basidiomycete wood decay fungi from across North America, and explore the linkages among functional trait expression, climate and phylogeny. Our analysis reveals a fundamental trade-off between abiotic stress tolerance and competitive ability, whereby fungi with wide thermal and moisture niches exhibit lower displacement ability. The magnitude of this dominance-tolerance trade-off is partially related to the environmental conditions under which the fungi were collected, with thermal niche traits exhibiting the strongest climate relationships. Nevertheless, moisture and thermal dominance-tolerance patterns exhibited contrasting phylogenetic signals, suggesting that these trends are influenced by a combination of niche sorting along taxonomic lines in tandem with acclimation and adaptation at the level of the individual. Collectively, our work reveals key insight into the life history strategies of saprotrophic fungi, demonstrating consistent trait trade-offs across broad spatial scales.},

	abstract = {Fungi play a key role in the global carbon cycle as the main decomposers of litter and wood. Although current climate models reflect limited functional variation in microbial groups, fungi differ vastly in their decomposing ability. Here, we examine which traits explain fungal-mediated wood decomposition. In a laboratory study of 34 fungal isolates, we found that decomposing ability varies along a spectrum from stress-tolerant, poorly decomposing fungi to fast-growing, competitive fungi that rapidly decompose wood. We observed similar patterns in a 5-y field experiment, in which communities of fast-growing fungi more rapidly decomposed logs in the forest. Finally, we show how linking decomposition rates to known spatial patterns in fungal traits could improve broad-scale predictions of wood decomposition by fungi.As the primary decomposers of organic material in terrestrial ecosystems, fungi are critical agents of the global carbon cycle. Yet our ability to link fungal community composition to ecosystem functioning is constrained by a limited understanding of the factors accounting for different wood decomposition rates among fungi. Here we examine which traits best explain fungal decomposition ability by combining detailed trait-based assays on 34 saprotrophic fungi from across North America in the laboratory with a 5-y field study comprising 1,582 fungi isolated from 74 decomposing logs. Fungal growth rate (hyphal extension rate) was the strongest single predictor of fungal-mediated wood decomposition rate under laboratory conditions, and accounted for up to 27\% of the in situ variation in decomposition in the field. At the individual level, decomposition rate was negatively correlated with moisture niche width (an indicator of drought stress tolerance) and with the production of nutrient-mineralizing extracellular enzymes. Together, these results suggest that decomposition rates strongly align with a dominance-tolerance life-history trade-off that was previously identified in these isolates, forming a spectrum from slow-growing, stress-tolerant fungi that are poor decomposers to fast-growing, highly competitive fungi with fast decomposition rates. Our study illustrates how an understanding of fungal trait variation could improve our predictive ability of the early and midstages of wood decay, to which our findings are most applicable. By mapping our results onto the biogeographic distribution of the dominance-tolerance trade-off across North America, we approximate broad-scale patterns in intrinsic fungal-mediated wood decomposition rates.},

In fact, SOM decomposition is catalyzed by extracellular enzymes that are produced by microorganisms. We built a simple theoretical model to explore the behavior of the decomposition–microbial growth system when the fundamental kinetic assumption is changed from first order kinetics to exoenzymes catalyzed decomposition (dC/dt=KC×Enzymes). An analysis of the enzyme kinetics showed that there must be some mechanism to produce a non-linear response of decomposition rates to enzyme concentration—the most likely is competition for enzyme binding on solid substrates as predicted by Langmuir adsorption isotherm theory. This non-linearity also induces C limitation, regardless of the potential supply of C. The linked C and N version of the model showed that actual polymer breakdown and microbial use of the released monomers can be disconnected, and that it requires relatively little N to maintain the maximal rate of decomposition, regardless of the microbial biomass’ ability to use the breakdown products. In this model, adding a pulse of C to an N limited system increases respiration, while adding N actually decreases respiration (as C is redirected from waste respiration to microbial growth). For many years, researchers have argued that the lack of a respiratory response by soil microbes to added N indicates that they are not N limited. This model suggests that conclusion may be wrong. While total C flow may be limited by the functioning of the exoenzyme system, actual microbial growth may be N limited.}

This is essential to choose the model that best describes the data and guide modeling efforts. Mathematical modeling of growth of filamentous fungi is necessary in fungal biology for gaining systems level understanding on hyphal and colony behaviors in different environments. A critical challenge in the development of these mathematical models arises from the indeterminate nature of their colony architecture, which is a result of processing diverse intracellular signals induced in response to a heterogeneous set of physical and nutritional factors. There exists a practical gap in connecting fungal growth models with measurement data. Here, we address this gap by introducing the first unified computational framework based on Bayesian inference that can quantify individual model errors and rank the statistical models based on their descriptive power against data. We show that this Bayesian model comparison is just a natural formalization of Occam׳s razor. The application of this framework is discussed in comparing three models in the context of synthetic data generated from a known true fungal growth model. This framework of model comparison achieves a trade-off between data fitness and model complexity and the quantified model error not only helps in calibrating and comparing the models, but also in making better predictions and guiding model refinements.}

For this reason, they provide a convenient model system for some aspects of tissue growth in higher organisms. A mathematical description of growth and branching in fungi is derived in terms of continuum variables such as densities of filaments and tips of filaments. The equations contain a term for branching which takes on specific mathematical forms for distinct fungal morphologies (lateral or dichotomous branching, anastomosis, etc.). By analysing propagating solutions to these equations it is demonstrated that certain branching strategies may be advantageous to the propagation of the tissue. The model also suggests causes for ring-like patterns occasionally associated with the colonies of certain species of fungi.}

Explicit equations for the rate of decomposition, mineralizations and immobilization are given. The main assumption of the model is that the rate of decomposition of any substrate is proportional to the growth rate of its decomposers. The main results of the model are: 1. Addition of extra nitrogen to materials poor in nitrogen increase their rate of decomposition; 2. Addition of extra nitrogen to a substrate whose initial carbon/nitrogen ratio is above a critical ratio (20–30) causes a decrease in the substrate's carbon/nitrogen ratio during its decomposition; 3. If the initial carbon/nitrogen ratio is below the critical one, no change in the substrate's ratio will occur with time; 4. Net mineralization of organic-nitrogen occurs when the substrate being decomposed has an initial carbon/nitrogen ratio which is below the critical one; 5. Addition of ammonium to such a substrate (point 4) will increase the rate of organic-nitrogen mineralization but not necessarily the rate of net mineralization. All the model results are analytical and independent of the values for the various parameters. Nevertheless the application of the model to real field conditions is discussed while presenting a numerical example.}

Relative competitive success of each species is assessed over time in terms of propagule production and substrate colonisation by each species. In an agricultural soil Mucor hiemalis usually out-competed Trichoderma harzianum. After 27 days, the success of both species in the mixtures was independent of the initial biomass concentration of either species, although the success of T. harzianum in these mixtures was substantially inhibited relative to the T. harzianum monocultures. In a forest soil, T. polysporum maintained a competitive advantage over M. hiemalis, and induced M. hiemalis to produce propagules rather than mycelia. Coexistence of both species always occurred in both experiments, and in the forest soil experiment the two-species mixtures all contained a higher total microbial biomass than the monocultures of either species by day 47, suggesting some niche differentiation.},

	abstract = {The relationship between biodiversity and biogeochemical processes gained much interest in light of the rapidly decreasing biodiversity worldwide. In this article, we discuss the current status, challenges and prospects of functional concepts to plant litter diversity and microbial decomposer diversity. We also evaluate whether these concepts permit a better understanding of how biodiversity is linked to litter decomposition as a key ecosystem process influencing carbon and nutrient cycles. Based on a literature survey, we show that plant litter and microbial diversity matters for decomposition, but that considering numbers of taxonomic units appears overall as little relevant and less useful than functional diversity. However, despite easily available functional litter traits and the well-established theoretical framework for functional litter diversity, the impact of functional litter diversity on decomposition is not yet well enough explored. Defining functional diversity of microorganisms remains one of the biggest challenges for functional approaches to microbial diversity. Recent developments in microarray and metagenomics technology offer promising possibilities in the assessment of the functional structure of microbial communities. This might allow significant progress in measuring functional microbial diversity and ultimately in our ability to predict consequences of biodiversity loss in the decomposer system for biogeochemical processes.}

Given high species diversity in microbial communities and the ability of microbes to adapt rapidly to new conditions, this assumption of functional redundancy seems plausible. We test the assumption by comparing litter decomposition rates in experimental microcosms inoculated with distinct microbial communities. We find that rates of carbon dioxide production from litter decomposition were dependent upon the microbial inoculum, with differences in the microbial community alone accounting for substantial (∼20\%) variation in total carbon mineralized. Communities that shared a common history with a given foliar litter exhibited higher decomposition rates when compared to communities foreign to that habitat. Our results suggest that the implicit assumption in ecosystem models (i.e., microbial communities in the same environment are functionally equivalent) is incorrect. To predict accurately how biogeochemical processes will respond to global change may require consideration of the community composition and/or adaptation of microbial communities to past resource environments.},

	abstract = {Despite the central role of microorganisms in the decomposition of dead organic matter, few models have integrated the dynamics of litter chemistry with microbial interactions. Here we propose a functional resolution of the microbial community that parallels the commonly used chemical characterization of plant litter, i.e., a guild of opportunist microorganisms that grows quickly and has high affinity for soluble substrates, a guild of decomposer specialists that grows more slowly and has high affinity for holocellulose substrates, and a guild of miners that grows very slowly and is specialized for degrading lignin. This guild-based decomposition model (GDM) includes the interactions of holocellulose and lignin, manifest as mutual feedback controls on microbial-based activities. It also includes N limitations on early stages of litter decay resulting from nutritional demands of microorganisms and N inhibition on late stages of litter decay resulting from reduced lignin degradation. Competitive interactions between microbial guilds result from different growth rates and substrate affinities, given limits on microbial colonization of litter. Simulations are consistent with commonly reported and proposed patterns of microbial community succession during litter decay, changes in and controls imposed by litter chemistry, and system responses to N availability. Modest impacts of litter chemistry and N effects on patterns of decay can yield substantial impacts on the relative amount of litter remaining through time, the time required to stabilize litter carbon (i.e., as the lignin content approaches Ìf70\% of the total litter carbon), the relative contributions of different guilds to decay, and the net amount of microbial production. Moreover, seemingly inconsistent patterns in system responses to N regimes can be explained by interactions between litter chemistry and microbial guilds. A validation exercise demonstrated general correspondence of model behavior to field observations. However, relationships among mass loss, litter chemistry, and N availability were more variable in field studies than in simulations. Also, observed changes in litter quality indicated the progressive accumulation of microbial products. Hence, field studies suggest expanding GDM to include dynamics of microbial products and also suggest the utility of GDM in exploring site effects on decomposition as a result of differences in microbial community composition.},

Combative mechanisms include antagonism at a distance, hyphal interference, mycoparasitism and gross mycelial contact. Interactions can result in deadlock or replacement, and a hierarchy of combative ability can be discerned amongst fungi that inhabit particular resources, but within this hierarchy there exists intransitivity, modification of outcome by other species and abiotic variables.

	Abstract = {Ecological niche breadth and the mechanisms facilitating its evolution are fundamental to understanding adaptation to changing environments, persistence of generalist and specialist lineages and the formation of new species. Woody substrates are structurally complex resources utilized by organisms with specialized decay machinery. Wood-decaying fungi represent ideal model systems to study evolution of niche breadth, as they vary greatly in their host range and preferred decay stage of the substrate. In order to dissect the genetic basis for niche specialization in the invasive brown rot fungus Serpula lacrymans, we used phenotyping and integrative analysis of phylogenomic and transcriptomic data to compare this species to wild relatives in the Serpulaceae with a range of specialist to generalist decay strategies. Our results indicate specialist species have rewired regulatory networks active during wood decay towards decreased reliance on enzymatic machinery, and therefore nitrogen-intensive decay components. This shift was likely accompanied with adaptation to a narrow tree line habitat and switch to a pioneer decomposer strategy, both requiring rapid colonization of a nitrogen-limited substrate. Among substrate specialists with narrow niches, we also found evidence for pathways facilitating reversal to generalism, highlighting how evolution may move along different axes of niche space.},

	abstract = {Soil microbial communities are so vastly diverse that complex interactions, which alter ecosystem functions, may occur among microbial species and functional groups. In this review, we explore the empirical evidence for situations when shifts in the community structure of microbes would elicit a change in ecosystem process rates, specifically decomposition, even when microbial biomass remains constant. In particular, we are interested in a subset of these scenarios in which knowledge of microbial community structure would improve model predictions for ecosystem functions. Results from microcosm and field studies indicate that microbial species diversity, functional group diversity, and community composition can all influence ecosystem process rates. The underlying mechanisms that may elicit changes in ecosystem functions from shifts in microbial community structure include evolutionary constraints on microbial trait adaptation, trait correlations, dispersal limitation, and species interactions. The extent of microbial diversity in soils is not known, so it is presently not possible to model all scenarios of microbial community structure shifts. However, by incorporating documented patterns in functional groups that are relevant for a particular ecosystem process and potential relationships between microbial phylogeny and function, the predictive power of process models will be significantly improved. The inclusion of this information into process models is critical for predicting and understanding how ecosystem functions may shift in response to global change.}

We incubated these soils with different 13C-labelled substrates with or without inorganic N addition and analyzed microbial substrate utilization by 13C-phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis. Our results revealed that the fate of labile C (glucose) was similar in the three microbial communities, despite differences in absolute substrate incorporation between the summer and winter community. The active microbial community involved in degradation of complex C substrates (cellulose, plant cell walls), however, differed between girdling and control plots and was strongly affected by inorganic N addition. Enhanced N availability strongly increased fungal degradation of cellulose and plant cell walls. Our results indicate that fungi, at least in the presence of a high N supply, are the main decomposers of polymeric C substrates.}",

Bacteria and fungi are abundant in soil and forest floors, actively recycling biomass mainly by extracting sugars from holocellulose degradation. Here we review the genome-wide contents of seven Aspergillus species and unravel hundreds of gene models encoding holocellulose-degrading enzymes. Numerous apparent gene duplications followed functional evolution, grouping similar genes into smaller coherent functional families according to specialized structural features, domain organization, biochemical activity, and genus genome distribution. Aspergilli contain about 37 cellulase gene models, clustered in two mechanistic categories: 27 hydrolyze and 10 oxidize glycosidic bonds. Within the oxidative enzymes, we found two cellobiose dehydrogenases that produce oxygen radicals utilized by eight lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases that oxidize glycosidic linkages, breaking crystalline cellulose chains and making them accessible to hydrolytic enzymes. Among the hydrolases, six cellobiohydrolases with a tunnel-like structural fold embrace single crystalline cellulose chains and cooperate at nonreducing or reducing end termini, splitting off cellobiose. Five endoglucanases group into four structural families and interact randomly and internally with cellulose through an open cleft catalytic domain, and finally, seven extracellular β-glucosidases cleave cellobiose and related oligomers into glucose. Aspergilli contain, on average, 30 hemicellulase and 7 accessory gene models, distributed among 9 distinct functional categories: the backbone-attacking enzymes xylanase, mannosidase, arabinase, and xyloglucanase, the short-side-chain-removing enzymes xylan α-1,2-glucuronidase, arabinofuranosidase, and xylosidase, and the accessory enzymes acetyl xylan and feruloyl esterases.},

	abstract = {Numerous empirical studies have described the pathways of mass, C and N flows during decomposition, but there remains a paucity of data on underlying mechanisms in arid ecosystems. In the northern Chihuahuan Desert, termites remove large quantities of litter and act as carbon and nitrogen sinks, contributing to low soil fertility. In their absence, decomposition at the soil surface is primarily driven by abiotic weathering, but studies suggest buried litter decay occurs through microbiological activities. We develop a general, synthetic model to examine the interactions between buried litter, decomposer microorganisms, and C and N pools in this ecosystem. Our goal is to explore the mechanisms underlying observed patterns of decomposition in arid systems using a modelling approach that balances simplicity with enough detail to suggest the reasons for system behavior. To this end, we utilize elements of existing models, interfacing microbial physiology and population dynamics with empirical observations of C and N pool dynamics, litter mass loss and changing C:N ratios. Good agreement was achieved between simulated and observed patterns of mass loss and nitrogen concentrations once a time lag describing the microbial colonization of litter was included. Model results indicate nutrient availabilities may be determined by relatively short-term carbon dynamics mediated by microflora since soil organic matter and nitrogen content are low. Model behavior also suggests decomposer organisms immobilize nitrogen from surrounding soils, accounting for the elevated quantities observed within decaying materials. Past hypotheses have proposed that soil flora and fauna partially decouple decomposition processes from abiotic constraints in this system. This study indicates that the pattern of microbial activities, accounting for the decomposition of buried materials in the absence of termites, is primarily determined by climatic conditions.}

We develop and analyse a model of the growth of AM fungi associated with plant roots, suitable for describing mechanistically the effects of the fungi on solute uptake by plants. The model describes the development and distribution of the fungal mycelium in soil in terms of the creation and death of hyphae, tip–tip and tip–hypha anastomosis, and the nature of the root–fungus interface. It is calibrated and corroborated using published experimental data for hyphal length densities at different distances away from root surfaces. A good agreement between measured and simulated values was found for three fungal species with different morphologies: Scutellospora calospora (Nicol. \&amp; Gerd.) Walker \&amp; Sanders; Glomus sp.; and Acaulospora laevis Gerdemann \&amp; Trappe associated with Trifolium subterraneum L. The model and findings are expected to contribute to the quantification of the role of AM fungi in plant mineral nutrition and the interpretation of different foraging strategies among fungal species. }

In this work, we characterize the hyphal network expansion and the structure of the fungus Podospora anserina under controlled culture conditions. To this end, temporal series of pictures of the network dynamics are produced, starting from germinating ascospores and ending when the network reaches a few centimeters width, with a typical image resolution of several micrometers. The completely automated image reconstruction steps allow an easy post-processing and a quantitative analysis of the dynamics. The main features of the evolution of the hyphal network, such as the total length L of the mycelium, the number of ``nodes''(or crossing points) N and the number of apexes A, can then be precisely quantified. Beyond these main features, the determination of the distribution of the intra-thallus surfaces (Si) and the statistical analysis of some local measures of N, A and L give new insights on the dynamics of expanding fungal networks. Based on these results, we now aim at developing robust and versatile discrete/continuous mathematical models to further understand the key mechanisms driving the development of the fungus thallus.},

The buoyant density of pure bacterial cultures ranged from 1.035 to 1.093 g/cm, and their dry-matter content ranged from 12 to 33{\%} (wt/wt).

Average values proposed for the conversion of hyphal biovolume into biomass dry weight are 1.09 g/cm and 21{\%} dry matter. Three of the bacterial isolates were found to have cell capsules. The calculated buoyant density and percent dry weight of these capsules varied from 1.029 g/cm and 7{\%} dry weight to 1.084 g/cm and 44{\%} dry weight. The majority of the fungi were found to produce large amounts of extracellular material when grown in liquid cultures. This material was not produced when the fungi were grown on either sterile spruce needles or membrane filters on an agar surface.

	abstract = {Abstract Decomposition of soil carbon stocks is one of the largest potential biotic feedbacks to climate change. Models of decomposition of soil organic matter and of soil respiration rely on empirical functions that relate variation in temperature and soil water content to rates of microbial metabolism using soil-C substrates. Here, we describe a unifying modeling framework to combine the effects of temperature, soil water content, and soluble substrate supply on decomposition of soluble soil-C substrates using simple functions based on process concepts. The model's backbone is the Michaelis–Menten equation, which describes the relationship between reaction velocity and soluble organic-C and O2 substrate concentrations at an enzyme's reactive site, which are determined by diffusivity functions based on soil water content. Temperature sensitivity is simulated by allowing the maximum velocity of the reaction (Vmax) to vary according to Arrhenius function. The Dual Arrhenius and Michaelis–Menten kinetics (DAMM) model core was able to predict effectively observations from of laboratory enzyme assays of β-glucosidase and phenol-oxidase across a range of substrate concentrations and incubation temperatures. The model also functioned as well or better than purely empirical models for simulating hourly and seasonal soil respiration data from a trenched plot in a deciduous forest at the Harvard Forest, in northeastern United States. The DAMM model demonstrates that enzymatic processes can be intrinsically temperature sensitive, but environmental constrains of substrate supply under soil moisture extremes can prevent that response to temperature from being observed. We discuss how DAMM could serve as a core module that is informed by other modules regarding microbial dynamics and supply of soluble-C substrates from plant inputs and from desorption of physically stabilized soil-C pools. Most importantly, it presents a way forward from purely empirical representation of temperature and moisture responses and integrates temperature-sensitive enzymatic processes with constraints of substrate supply.},

	Abstract = {The temperature sensitivity of enzymes responsible for organic matter decomposition in soil is crucial for predicting the effects of global warming on the carbon cycle and sequestration. We tested the hypothesis that differences in temperature sensitivity of enzyme kinetic parameters V max and K m will lead to a canceling effect: strong reduction of temperature response of catalytic reactions. Short-term temperature response of V max and K m of three hydrolytic enzymes responsible for decomposition of cellulose (β-glucosidase, cellobiohydrolase) and hemicelluloses (xylanase) were analyzed in situ from 0 to 40$\,^{\circ}$C. The apparent activation energy varied between enzymes from 20.7 to 35.2 kJ mol(-1) corresponding to the Q 10 values of the enzyme activities of 1.4-1.9 (with V max - Q 10 1.0-2.5 and K m - Q 10 0.94-2.3). Temperature response of all tested enzymes fitted well to the Arrhenius equation. Despite that, the fitting of Arrhenius model revealed the non-linear increase of two cellulolytic enzymes activities with two distinct thresholds at 10-15$\,^{\circ}$C and 25-30$\,^{\circ}$C, which were less pronounced for xylanase. The nonlinearity between 10 and 15$\,^{\circ}$C was explained by 30-80{\%} increase in V max . At 25-30$\,^{\circ}$C, however, the abrupt decrease of enzyme-substrate affinity was responsible for non-linear increase of enzyme activities. Our study is the first demonstrating nonlinear response of V max and K m to temperature causing canceling effect, which was most strongly pronounced at low substrate concentrations and at temperatures above 15$\,^{\circ}$C. Under cold climate, however, the regulation of hydrolytic activity by canceling in response to warming is negligible because canceling was never observed below 10$\,^{\circ}$C. The canceling, therefore, can be considered as natural mechanism reducing the effects of global warming on decomposition of soil organics at moderate temperatures. The non-linearity of enzyme responses to warming and the respective thresholds should therefore be investigated for other enzymes, and incorporated into Earth system models to improve the predictions at regional and global levels.},

	Abstract = {Litter decomposition is the fundamental process in nutrient cycling and soil carbon (C) sequestration in terrestrial ecosystems. The global-wide increase in nitrogen (N) inputs is expected to alter litter decomposition and, ultimately, affect ecosystem C storage and nutrient status. Temperate grassland ecosystems in China are usually N-deficient and particularly sensitive to the changes in exogenous N additions. In this paper, we conducted a 1,200-day in situ experiment in a typical semi-arid temperate steppe in Inner Mongolia to investigate the litter decomposition as well as the dynamics of litter C and N concentrations under three N addition levels (low N with 50 kg N/(hm2·a) (LN), medium N with 100 kg N/(hm2·a) (MN), and high N with 200 kg N/(hm2·a) (HN)) and three N addition forms (ammonium-N-based with 100 kg N/(hm2·a) as ammonium sulfate (AS), nitrate-N-based with 100 kg N/(hm2·a) as sodium nitrate (SN), and mixed-N-based with 100 kg N/(hm2·a) as calcium ammonium nitrate (CAN)) compared to control with no N addition (CK). The results indicated that the litter mass remaining in all N treatments exhibited a similar decomposition pattern: fast decomposition within the initial 120 days, followed by a relatively slow decomposition in the remaining observation period (120--1,200 days). The decomposition pattern in each treatment was fitted well in two split-phase models, namely, a single exponential decay model in phase I (<398 days) and a linear decay function in phase II (>398 days). The three N addition levels exerted insignificant effects on litter decomposition in the early stages (<398 days, phase I; P>0.05). However, MN and HN treatments inhibited litter mass loss after 398 and 746 days, respectively (P<0.05). AS and SN treatments exerted similar effects on litter mass remaining during the entire decomposition period (P>0.05). The effects of these two N addition forms differed greatly from those of CAN after 746 and 1,053 days, respectively (P<0.05). During the decomposition period, N concentrations in the decomposing litter increased whereas C concentrations decreased, which also led to an exponential decrease in litter C:N ratios in all treatments. No significant effects were induced by N addition levels and forms on litter C and N concentrations (P>0.05). Our results indicated that exogenous N additions could exhibit neutral or inhibitory effects on litter decomposition, and the inhibitory effects of N additions on litter decomposition in the final decay stages are not caused by the changes in the chemical qualities of the litter, such as endogenous N and C concentrations. These results will provide an important data basis for the simulation and prediction of C cycle processes in future N-deposition scenarios.},

	abstract = {Decomposition is a complex suite of processes that strongly affects the mineralization and immobilization of mineral nutrients. Thus, considerable research has focused on gaining a mechanistic understanding of litter decay. Models of decay vary with respect to detail, but most utilize decay rate coefficients for particular chemical constituents of litter, derived from empirical observations of turnover. Recent studies have shown that the activities of extracellular enzymes are correlated with decay, and represent instantaneous measures of biochemical processes responsible for the hydrolysis of particular chemical compounds. For these reasons, temporal patterns in turnover rates for particular litter constituents should correspond to activity levels of particular degradative enzymes. To test this hypothesis, we modified a general model of litter decay (GENDEC) to predict activities of extracellular enzymes. This was accomplished by viewing turnover rates for carbon fractions of litter (extractive, acid-soluble and acid-insoluble compounds) as surrogates for the activity levels of relevant extracellular enzymes (e.g., glucosidase, cellulases, oxidases). The resulting temporal patterns of litter turnover rates generated by the model were similar to observed patterns of enzyme activities. These results demonstrated that traditional modeling approaches may be used to predict patterns of enzyme activities, although existing data are not sufficient to conduct a rigorous quantitative test of this approach. Conversely, assays of extracellular enzymes could be used to test models of litter decay with a high degree of chemical and temporal resolution, because enzymes catalyze specific reactions and measures of activity levels represent instantaneous rates of degradation.}

Prosopis glandulosa at this research site acquired its water from a ground water source 4-6 m deep. Measurements of diurnal and seasonal cycles of aboveground environmental conditions, soil moisture, and soil water potential (to 6 m depth) were taken to ascertain environmental water availability and water stress. Leaf water potential, leaf conductance, leaf transpiration, relative saturation deficit of leaves, osmotic potential, and turgor potential were measured to evaluate plant adaptations to environmental water stress. Soil water potential was low (-4.0 to -5.0 MPa) in surface soil in relation to deep soil (-0.2) MPa). This difference was due to high surface soil salinity and low surface water content. the climatic conditions at the research site produced extreme water stress conditions in summer months when temperatures reached 50@?C, vapor pressure deficit (VPD) reached 8 kPa, and surface soil water potential was below -4.5 MPa. Although considerable plant water stress developed in these trees (midday leaf water potential -4.8 MPa), osmotic adjustment occurred and turgor was maintained on a diurnal and seasonal cycle. Prosopis glandulosa has adapted to avoid water stress by utilizing deep ground water, but this phreatophyte has also evolved physiological adaptations, such as osmotic adjustment and seasonally changing stomatal sensitivity to VPD, which result in greater tolerance of water stress.},

We tested two predictions from this hypothesis in a shrubland of central semi-arid Argentina: (1) the correlation between plant water potential and soil water potential in the upper layers is stronger for grasses than for shrubs and (2) rooting depth is greater for shrubs than for grasses. The apparent pattern of water use by the deciduous shrub (Prosopis caldenia) and the two perennial grasses (Stipa tenuis and Piptochaetium napostaense) under study was consistent with the two-layer hypothesis whereas the evergreen shrub (Condalia microphylla) did not support this model. Our results suggest that the pattern of water use by grasses and shrubs in shrublands may be dependent upon strategies to counteract water stress and the phenological patterns developed by species within each life form.}

	abstract = {Abstract Local tree species distributions in tropical forests correlate strongly with soil water availability. However, it is unclear how species distributions are shaped by demographic responses to soil water availability. Specifically, it remains unknown how growth affects species distributions along water availability gradients relative to mortality. We quantified spatial variation in dry season soil water potential (SWP) in the moist tropical forest on Barro Colorado Island, Panama, and used a hierarchical Bayesian approach to evaluate relationships between demographic responses of naturally regenerating seedlings to SWP (RGRs and first-year mortality) and species distributions along the SWP gradient for 62 species. We also tested whether species that were more abundant at the wet or dry end of the gradient performed better (a) at their “home end” of the gradient (“best at home” hypothesis) and (b) “at home” compared to co-occurring species (“home advantage” hypothesis). Four and five species responded significantly to SWP in terms of growth or mortality respectively. Growth (but not mortality) responses were positively related to species distributions along the SWP gradient; species with a more positive (negative) growth response to SWP were more abundant at higher (lower) SWP, that is, at wetter (drier) sites. In addition, wet distributed species grew faster on the wet end of the SWP gradient than on the dry end (“best at home”) and grew faster on the wet end than dry distributed species (“home advantage”). Mortality rates declined with seedling size for all species. Thus, seedling growth responses to SWP indirectly shaped local species distributions by influencing seedling size and thereby mortality risk. Synthesis. By demonstrating how growth responses to spatial variation in soil water availability affect species distributions, we identified a demographic process underlying niche differentiation on hydrological gradients in tropical forests. Recognizing the role of these growth responses in shaping species distributions should improve the understanding of tropical forest composition and diversity along rainfall gradients and with climate change.},

	abstract = {Carbon cycle models often lack explicit belowground organism activity, yet belowground organisms regulate carbon storage and release in soil. Ectomycorrhizal fungi are important players in the carbon cycle because they are a conduit into soil for carbon assimilated by the plant. It is hypothesized that ectomycorrhizal fungi can also be active decomposers when plant carbon allocation to fungi is low. Here, we reviewed the literature on ectomycorrhizal decomposition and we developed a simulation model of the plant-mycorrhizae interaction where a reduction in plant productivity stimulates ectomycorrhizal fungi to decompose soil organic matter. Our review highlights evidence demonstrating the potential for ectomycorrhizal fungi to decompose soil organic matter. Our model output suggests that ectomycorrhizal activity accounts for a portion of carbon decomposed in soil, but this portion varied with plant productivity and the mycorrhizal carbon uptake strategy simulated. Lower organic matter inputs to soil were largely responsible for reduced soil carbon storage. Using mathematical theory, we demonstrated that biotic interactions affect predictions of ecosystem functions. Specifically, we developed a simple function to model the mycorrhizal switch in function from plant symbiont to decomposer. We show that including mycorrhizal fungi with the flexibility of mutualistic and saprotrophic lifestyles alters predictions of ecosystem function.},

@article{Kari2014,
	Abstract = {Cellobiohydrolases are exo-active glycosyl hydrolases that processively convert cellulose to soluble sugars, typically cellobiose. They effectively break down crystalline cellulose and make up a major component in industrial enzyme mixtures used for deconstruction of lignocellulosic biomass. Identification of the rate-limiting step for cellobiohydrolases remains controversial, and recent reports have alternately suggested either association (on-rate) or dissociation (off-rate) as the overall bottleneck. Obviously, this uncertainty hampers both fundamental mechanistic understanding and rational design of enzymes with improved industrial applicability. To elucidate the role of on- and off-rates, respectively, on the overall kinetics, we have expressed a variant in which a tryptophan residue (Trp-38) in the middle of the active tunnel has been replaced with an alanine. This mutation weakens complex formation, and the population of substrate-bound W38A was only about half of the wild type. Nevertheless, the maximal, steady-state rate was twice as high for the variant enzyme. It is argued that these opposite effects on binding and activity can be reconciled if the rate-limiting step is after the catalysis (i.e. in the dissociation process).},

abstract = { A mathematical model that reproduces fungal proliferation and morphological colony formation was developed on the basis of a reaction diffusion modelling approach. In this modelling, fungal life stage was separated into two, active and inactive stage, and it was assumed that active fungus moves by diffusion and reaction while generating and producing inactive fungus. The effects of temperature and humidity on fungal growth were explicitly incorporated in the reaction term of nutrient consumption/production of active fungus in this governing equation. The damping function, which reproduces the effects of temperature and humidity on fungal growth, was developed and explicitly based on the fungal index proposed by K. Abe. In order to estimate the sensitivity of the proposed numerical fungal growth model, fungal growth on the surface of building materials was analysed for four types of building materials, and the prediction results were compared with the results of WUFI-Bio and the fungal index. }

	abstract = {In this work, we present a new PDE model of the growth of Postia placenta, a species of brown rot fungus. The formulation was derived mainly from the biological mechanisms embedded in our discrete model, validated against experimental data. In order to mimic the growth mechanisms, we propose a new reaction-diffusion formulation, based on three variables: the concentration of tips, the branch density and the total hyphal density. The evolution of tips obeys a reaction-diffusion model, with constant diffusivity, while the evolution of the two other variables results from time integrals. The numerical solution is in excellent agreement with the averaged radial tip/hyphal densities of the mycelial network obtained by the discrete model. Thanks to the efficient exponential Euler method with Krylov subspace approximation, the solution needs only 3.5 s of CPU time to simulate 104-day of mycelium growth, in comparison with 8 hours for the discrete model. The great reduction of the RAM memory and computing time gives the possibility to upscale the simulation. The novelty of the PDE system is that the spatial colonization is formulated as a diffusion mechanism, which is self-standing, contrary to models based on an advection term. The continuous model can also reproduce the radial densities when the growth parameters in the discrete model are varied to adapt to different growth conditions. The correlation constructed between the two models provides us a tool for mutual insights between local biological mechanisms to the global biomass distribution, especially when analyzing experimental data.}

	Abstract = {Fungi are the primary agents of terrestrial decomposition, yet our understanding of fungal biogeography lags far behind that of plants, animals and bacteria. Here, we use a trait-based approach to quantify the niches of 23 species of basidiomycete wood decay fungi from across North America, and explore the linkages among functional trait expression, climate and phylogeny. Our analysis reveals a fundamental trade-off between abiotic stress tolerance and competitive ability, whereby fungi with wide thermal and moisture niches exhibit lower displacement ability. The magnitude of this dominance-tolerance trade-off is partially related to the environmental conditions under which the fungi were collected, with thermal niche traits exhibiting the strongest climate relationships. Nevertheless, moisture and thermal dominance-tolerance patterns exhibited contrasting phylogenetic signals, suggesting that these trends are influenced by a combination of niche sorting along taxonomic lines in tandem with acclimation and adaptation at the level of the individual. Collectively, our work reveals key insight into the life history strategies of saprotrophic fungi, demonstrating consistent trait trade-offs across broad spatial scales.},

	abstract = {Fungi play a key role in the global carbon cycle as the main decomposers of litter and wood. Although current climate models reflect limited functional variation in microbial groups, fungi differ vastly in their decomposing ability. Here, we examine which traits explain fungal-mediated wood decomposition. In a laboratory study of 34 fungal isolates, we found that decomposing ability varies along a spectrum from stress-tolerant, poorly decomposing fungi to fast-growing, competitive fungi that rapidly decompose wood. We observed similar patterns in a 5-y field experiment, in which communities of fast-growing fungi more rapidly decomposed logs in the forest. Finally, we show how linking decomposition rates to known spatial patterns in fungal traits could improve broad-scale predictions of wood decomposition by fungi.As the primary decomposers of organic material in terrestrial ecosystems, fungi are critical agents of the global carbon cycle. Yet our ability to link fungal community composition to ecosystem functioning is constrained by a limited understanding of the factors accounting for different wood decomposition rates among fungi. Here we examine which traits best explain fungal decomposition ability by combining detailed trait-based assays on 34 saprotrophic fungi from across North America in the laboratory with a 5-y field study comprising 1,582 fungi isolated from 74 decomposing logs. Fungal growth rate (hyphal extension rate) was the strongest single predictor of fungal-mediated wood decomposition rate under laboratory conditions, and accounted for up to 27\% of the in situ variation in decomposition in the field. At the individual level, decomposition rate was negatively correlated with moisture niche width (an indicator of drought stress tolerance) and with the production of nutrient-mineralizing extracellular enzymes. Together, these results suggest that decomposition rates strongly align with a dominance-tolerance life-history trade-off that was previously identified in these isolates, forming a spectrum from slow-growing, stress-tolerant fungi that are poor decomposers to fast-growing, highly competitive fungi with fast decomposition rates. Our study illustrates how an understanding of fungal trait variation could improve our predictive ability of the early and midstages of wood decay, to which our findings are most applicable. By mapping our results onto the biogeographic distribution of the dominance-tolerance trade-off across North America, we approximate broad-scale patterns in intrinsic fungal-mediated wood decomposition rates.},

In fact, SOM decomposition is catalyzed by extracellular enzymes that are produced by microorganisms. We built a simple theoretical model to explore the behavior of the decomposition–microbial growth system when the fundamental kinetic assumption is changed from first order kinetics to exoenzymes catalyzed decomposition (dC/dt=KC×Enzymes). An analysis of the enzyme kinetics showed that there must be some mechanism to produce a non-linear response of decomposition rates to enzyme concentration—the most likely is competition for enzyme binding on solid substrates as predicted by Langmuir adsorption isotherm theory. This non-linearity also induces C limitation, regardless of the potential supply of C. The linked C and N version of the model showed that actual polymer breakdown and microbial use of the released monomers can be disconnected, and that it requires relatively little N to maintain the maximal rate of decomposition, regardless of the microbial biomass’ ability to use the breakdown products. In this model, adding a pulse of C to an N limited system increases respiration, while adding N actually decreases respiration (as C is redirected from waste respiration to microbial growth). For many years, researchers have argued that the lack of a respiratory response by soil microbes to added N indicates that they are not N limited. This model suggests that conclusion may be wrong. While total C flow may be limited by the functioning of the exoenzyme system, actual microbial growth may be N limited.}

This is essential to choose the model that best describes the data and guide modeling efforts. Mathematical modeling of growth of filamentous fungi is necessary in fungal biology for gaining systems level understanding on hyphal and colony behaviors in different environments. A critical challenge in the development of these mathematical models arises from the indeterminate nature of their colony architecture, which is a result of processing diverse intracellular signals induced in response to a heterogeneous set of physical and nutritional factors. There exists a practical gap in connecting fungal growth models with measurement data. Here, we address this gap by introducing the first unified computational framework based on Bayesian inference that can quantify individual model errors and rank the statistical models based on their descriptive power against data. We show that this Bayesian model comparison is just a natural formalization of Occam׳s razor. The application of this framework is discussed in comparing three models in the context of synthetic data generated from a known true fungal growth model. This framework of model comparison achieves a trade-off between data fitness and model complexity and the quantified model error not only helps in calibrating and comparing the models, but also in making better predictions and guiding model refinements.}

For this reason, they provide a convenient model system for some aspects of tissue growth in higher organisms. A mathematical description of growth and branching in fungi is derived in terms of continuum variables such as densities of filaments and tips of filaments. The equations contain a term for branching which takes on specific mathematical forms for distinct fungal morphologies (lateral or dichotomous branching, anastomosis, etc.). By analysing propagating solutions to these equations it is demonstrated that certain branching strategies may be advantageous to the propagation of the tissue. The model also suggests causes for ring-like patterns occasionally associated with the colonies of certain species of fungi.}

Explicit equations for the rate of decomposition, mineralizations and immobilization are given. The main assumption of the model is that the rate of decomposition of any substrate is proportional to the growth rate of its decomposers. The main results of the model are: 1. Addition of extra nitrogen to materials poor in nitrogen increase their rate of decomposition; 2. Addition of extra nitrogen to a substrate whose initial carbon/nitrogen ratio is above a critical ratio (20–30) causes a decrease in the substrate's carbon/nitrogen ratio during its decomposition; 3. If the initial carbon/nitrogen ratio is below the critical one, no change in the substrate's ratio will occur with time; 4. Net mineralization of organic-nitrogen occurs when the substrate being decomposed has an initial carbon/nitrogen ratio which is below the critical one; 5. Addition of ammonium to such a substrate (point 4) will increase the rate of organic-nitrogen mineralization but not necessarily the rate of net mineralization. All the model results are analytical and independent of the values for the various parameters. Nevertheless the application of the model to real field conditions is discussed while presenting a numerical example.}

Relative competitive success of each species is assessed over time in terms of propagule production and substrate colonisation by each species. In an agricultural soil Mucor hiemalis usually out-competed Trichoderma harzianum. After 27 days, the success of both species in the mixtures was independent of the initial biomass concentration of either species, although the success of T. harzianum in these mixtures was substantially inhibited relative to the T. harzianum monocultures. In a forest soil, T. polysporum maintained a competitive advantage over M. hiemalis, and induced M. hiemalis to produce propagules rather than mycelia. Coexistence of both species always occurred in both experiments, and in the forest soil experiment the two-species mixtures all contained a higher total microbial biomass than the monocultures of either species by day 47, suggesting some niche differentiation.},

	abstract = {The relationship between biodiversity and biogeochemical processes gained much interest in light of the rapidly decreasing biodiversity worldwide. In this article, we discuss the current status, challenges and prospects of functional concepts to plant litter diversity and microbial decomposer diversity. We also evaluate whether these concepts permit a better understanding of how biodiversity is linked to litter decomposition as a key ecosystem process influencing carbon and nutrient cycles. Based on a literature survey, we show that plant litter and microbial diversity matters for decomposition, but that considering numbers of taxonomic units appears overall as little relevant and less useful than functional diversity. However, despite easily available functional litter traits and the well-established theoretical framework for functional litter diversity, the impact of functional litter diversity on decomposition is not yet well enough explored. Defining functional diversity of microorganisms remains one of the biggest challenges for functional approaches to microbial diversity. Recent developments in microarray and metagenomics technology offer promising possibilities in the assessment of the functional structure of microbial communities. This might allow significant progress in measuring functional microbial diversity and ultimately in our ability to predict consequences of biodiversity loss in the decomposer system for biogeochemical processes.}

Given high species diversity in microbial communities and the ability of microbes to adapt rapidly to new conditions, this assumption of functional redundancy seems plausible. We test the assumption by comparing litter decomposition rates in experimental microcosms inoculated with distinct microbial communities. We find that rates of carbon dioxide production from litter decomposition were dependent upon the microbial inoculum, with differences in the microbial community alone accounting for substantial (∼20\%) variation in total carbon mineralized. Communities that shared a common history with a given foliar litter exhibited higher decomposition rates when compared to communities foreign to that habitat. Our results suggest that the implicit assumption in ecosystem models (i.e., microbial communities in the same environment are functionally equivalent) is incorrect. To predict accurately how biogeochemical processes will respond to global change may require consideration of the community composition and/or adaptation of microbial communities to past resource environments.},

	abstract = {Despite the central role of microorganisms in the decomposition of dead organic matter, few models have integrated the dynamics of litter chemistry with microbial interactions. Here we propose a functional resolution of the microbial community that parallels the commonly used chemical characterization of plant litter, i.e., a guild of opportunist microorganisms that grows quickly and has high affinity for soluble substrates, a guild of decomposer specialists that grows more slowly and has high affinity for holocellulose substrates, and a guild of miners that grows very slowly and is specialized for degrading lignin. This guild-based decomposition model (GDM) includes the interactions of holocellulose and lignin, manifest as mutual feedback controls on microbial-based activities. It also includes N limitations on early stages of litter decay resulting from nutritional demands of microorganisms and N inhibition on late stages of litter decay resulting from reduced lignin degradation. Competitive interactions between microbial guilds result from different growth rates and substrate affinities, given limits on microbial colonization of litter. Simulations are consistent with commonly reported and proposed patterns of microbial community succession during litter decay, changes in and controls imposed by litter chemistry, and system responses to N availability. Modest impacts of litter chemistry and N effects on patterns of decay can yield substantial impacts on the relative amount of litter remaining through time, the time required to stabilize litter carbon (i.e., as the lignin content approaches Ìf70\% of the total litter carbon), the relative contributions of different guilds to decay, and the net amount of microbial production. Moreover, seemingly inconsistent patterns in system responses to N regimes can be explained by interactions between litter chemistry and microbial guilds. A validation exercise demonstrated general correspondence of model behavior to field observations. However, relationships among mass loss, litter chemistry, and N availability were more variable in field studies than in simulations. Also, observed changes in litter quality indicated the progressive accumulation of microbial products. Hence, field studies suggest expanding GDM to include dynamics of microbial products and also suggest the utility of GDM in exploring site effects on decomposition as a result of differences in microbial community composition.},

Combative mechanisms include antagonism at a distance, hyphal interference, mycoparasitism and gross mycelial contact. Interactions can result in deadlock or replacement, and a hierarchy of combative ability can be discerned amongst fungi that inhabit particular resources, but within this hierarchy there exists intransitivity, modification of outcome by other species and abiotic variables.

	Abstract = {Ecological niche breadth and the mechanisms facilitating its evolution are fundamental to understanding adaptation to changing environments, persistence of generalist and specialist lineages and the formation of new species. Woody substrates are structurally complex resources utilized by organisms with specialized decay machinery. Wood-decaying fungi represent ideal model systems to study evolution of niche breadth, as they vary greatly in their host range and preferred decay stage of the substrate. In order to dissect the genetic basis for niche specialization in the invasive brown rot fungus Serpula lacrymans, we used phenotyping and integrative analysis of phylogenomic and transcriptomic data to compare this species to wild relatives in the Serpulaceae with a range of specialist to generalist decay strategies. Our results indicate specialist species have rewired regulatory networks active during wood decay towards decreased reliance on enzymatic machinery, and therefore nitrogen-intensive decay components. This shift was likely accompanied with adaptation to a narrow tree line habitat and switch to a pioneer decomposer strategy, both requiring rapid colonization of a nitrogen-limited substrate. Among substrate specialists with narrow niches, we also found evidence for pathways facilitating reversal to generalism, highlighting how evolution may move along different axes of niche space.},

	abstract = {Soil microbial communities are so vastly diverse that complex interactions, which alter ecosystem functions, may occur among microbial species and functional groups. In this review, we explore the empirical evidence for situations when shifts in the community structure of microbes would elicit a change in ecosystem process rates, specifically decomposition, even when microbial biomass remains constant. In particular, we are interested in a subset of these scenarios in which knowledge of microbial community structure would improve model predictions for ecosystem functions. Results from microcosm and field studies indicate that microbial species diversity, functional group diversity, and community composition can all influence ecosystem process rates. The underlying mechanisms that may elicit changes in ecosystem functions from shifts in microbial community structure include evolutionary constraints on microbial trait adaptation, trait correlations, dispersal limitation, and species interactions. The extent of microbial diversity in soils is not known, so it is presently not possible to model all scenarios of microbial community structure shifts. However, by incorporating documented patterns in functional groups that are relevant for a particular ecosystem process and potential relationships between microbial phylogeny and function, the predictive power of process models will be significantly improved. The inclusion of this information into process models is critical for predicting and understanding how ecosystem functions may shift in response to global change.}

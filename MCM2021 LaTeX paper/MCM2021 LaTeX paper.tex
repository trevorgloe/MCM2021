\section{Introduction}
This is a test of the introduction \cite{Gow1995}

Biodiversity's impact on the system's overall efficiency:
- the greater range you have of moisture/temperature niche widths, the more tolerant your fungal community will be overall to growing in any particular environmental because at least some constituents of the community will be close to idealized in that environment.
- competition rank correlates heavily with hyphal extension rate — fungal communities with species who are highly competitive will go one of two ways: 1. the environmental conditions are ideal for the smaller niches of the highly competitive isolates, and so those isolates will dominate out over the other ones 2. the environmental conditions are not ideal for the highly competitive isolates, so the slower but more robust isolates will win out

we have a spearman correlation coefficient relating production of each enzyme with decomposition rate — enzymes primarily involved with breaking down lignin (acid phosphatase) are strongly correlated with decreased decomposition rate.

Strong correlation that increase production of acid phospatase results in decreased competitive rank, which makes sense because on average slower-growing fungi are less competitive than faster growing ones. Competitive rank has a 0.6 spearman correlation coefficient with growth performance

Assumption: enzymes treatment of the different portions of holocellulose are the same 

Implementation: each enzyme has its production rate from the data, multiply the parameter by that production rate and sum them all together to get dC/dt


Prediction:
The slower stress tolerant fungi will have a share of enzymes that indicate their slow decomposition rate, but a moisture and temperature width that indicate their stress tolerance to environmental fluctuations. 

The faster fungi will have a share of enzymes that indicate their fast decomposition rate, but a moisture and temperature width that indicates their lack of stress tolerance to environmental fluctuations.

\subsection{Assumptions}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Growth
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[--] unlimited available resources (ground litter and woody fibers)
		\item[--] neglecting effects from direct interactions between fungi
		\item[--] PROBLEM: neglecting synergistic effects on growth/metabolic efficiency
		\item[--] non-exhaustive substrates
	\end{itemize}
	\item Decomposition Kinetics
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[--] Elements can be stacked in any configuration without structural limitations
	\end{itemize}
	\item Temperature/Moisture effects
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[--] Paths are perfectly straight
		\item[--] Every path only has either the delivery location or storage container as origin and destination
		\item[--] Paths are modeled in two dimensions i.e. no altitude changes are considered
		\item[--] Not considering effects of having multiple drones flying at once
	\end{itemize}
	\item Interactions
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[--] Influences from wind are neglected
		\item[--] The drones are assumed to be unobstructed by terrain
		\item[--] The drones do not experience any malfunctions

\[ 
L_n = \sum_{i=1}^{m} p_i(x_i, y_i) / \sum_{i=1}^{m} p_i 
\]
where $L_n$ = Location number within grouping \\
n being number of distinct locations (1 to 3) \\
i = hospitals in the group \\
p = package demand of hospital i \\
x, y = longitude, latitude of hospital i \\
The output lists a discrete set of groupings of the hospitals with the corresponding locations of the storage containers for each hospital group. In figure 1, one potential combination of hospitals grouped to specific storage locations is shown.

\subsection{Cost Function}
I've copied the ten diff eqs from Numerical Prediction Model for Fungal Growth Coupled with Hygrothermal Transfer in Building Materials here:

hygrothermal equations:

\begin{equation}
\frac{dH}{dT}\cdot\frac{\partial T}{\partial t}=\nabla\cdot(\lambda\nabla T)+h_v\nabla\cdot(\delta_{p}\nabla(\phi p_{sat}))
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\frac{dw}{d\phi}\cdot\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t}=\nabla\cdot(D_{\phi}\nabla\phi+\delta_{p}\nabla(\phi p_{sat})
\end{equation}

Chapter 15 Mathematical Modeling of Fungal Growth

\begin{equation}
\frac{\delta\rho}{\delta t}=nv-d(\rho)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\frac{\delta n}{\delta t}=\frac{\delta nv}{\delta x}+\sigma(\rho, n)
\end{equation}


Where $P$ represents the total medpacks delivered, $\sum{t}$ is an estimate of the time for all the flights to occur, and $S$ represents the space left after packing all the drones (computed via the packing algorithm). Also, $C$ is our cost function output, the cost. The factor of $100000$ dividing $S$ is there to adjust the units of $S$ (it being on the order of $10^5$ while $\frac{P}{\sum{t}}$ is on the order of $10^0$) The time estimates are computed via the basic kinematic equation assuming constant speed, $\sum{t}=\sum{\frac{d}{v_d}}$ summed over all drone flights in the given plan. Here $d$ is distance traveled in a specified flight and $v_d$ is the max speed of the drone flying. This estimate of the time taken for a flight is assuming the drone is flying at max speed the whole way, and assuming equality of the time taken to fly to the hospital, and the time to fly back. The assumption of perfectly sequential ordering of the flights allows us to sum the times of individual flights to get the total time.
